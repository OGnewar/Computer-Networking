## 1. What is Computer Network? Write its uses.

A computer network is a collection of interconnected computing devices (such as computers, servers, routers, and switches) that communicate with each other to share resources, data, and information. These devices are linked by various communication protocols over wired or wireless media.

Its uses are explained below:

    1.1 Business Application
        -Resource Sharing: sharing of hardware   (printer, scanner, fax), software and data across network irrespective of geographical location, reducing costs and increasing productivity.
High Reliability: high accessibility and availability of data since there are multiple copies in multiple devices across the network.
c.	Saving Money: little to no cost for sharing resources, no need to use mainframe computer, can use cheap desktop computer.
d.	Scalability: easy to add and integrate new devices into the network for higher computational power.
    1.2 Home Application
a.	E-commerce: paying bills, transfer cash, online shopping
b.	Access to Information: access to information anywhere at all times via the internet at home
c.	Communication: communicate via text, voice, video calls, etc.
d.	Entertainment: multiplayer games, videos, movies, music, social media, etc.
e.	Online Education: online classrooms, notebooks, youtube, websites, etc.
C.	Mobile Application
	Same features as home application but with mobile computers like cell phones, laptops, notebook computers and tablets.
	High portability and efficiency.
